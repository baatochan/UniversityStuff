### Task 1 - Which of the lists below do you think are the typical 'snakes', and which are the typical 'ladders'? Why?

When I have seen these lists for the first time I thought that the answer for that is the left list is for ladders while the right one is for snakes. I thought that because I had an assumption that a big corporation is a hostile environment and you need to be seen to climb to the top while standing for what you believe only puts you in a worse position. I had this assumption because this is how it looks like in a company I work for. However, I can agree with prof. Ben Fletcher that this is not a type of company you want to stay in for long.

In a good corporation with good management, this should not be a case and people from the right list should have a bright future, people that are good team members, and good leaders. People that are on the left list are hard to work with and won't be good leaders that's why they are the true snakes in this comparison.

Hello

Below you can find your assessment task topic:
```
Your university is conducting a survey about attitudes to engineering jobs in your country. They have asked for a report. You should describe:
•	whether engineering jobs have lost/gained respect during the past 10 years
•	explain why you think this has occurred
•	say what other changes in job status may take place in the future
```

Remember to use:

Headings – Include the following:
* Title
* introduction
* content
* recommendations
* conclusion  
(Sometimes conclusions come before recommendations, this doesn’t matter to me)

Remember to use formal English (no contractions, etc.)

For  a sample report see: www.blairenglish.com/exercises/emails/exercises/vocabulary-writing-business-reports-english/vocabulary-writing-business-reports-english.html

You can also use the resources I recommended last week.

I would like to look especially at the model answer and useful vocabulary.

Deadline: May, 29

If you have questions don’t hesitate to contact me.

One more last thing, I have received your previous homework, it takes time to mark everything because I have quite a few groups, so please, be patient. Thank you.

Good luck!

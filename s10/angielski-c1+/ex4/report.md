# Attitudes to engineering jobs in Poland

Bartosz Rodziewicz, 226105

## Introduction

The following report evaluates the current attitude toward engineering jobs in Poland and its change in the last 10 years. The aim of this report is to demonstrate the factors causing it and illustrate what could happen in the future.

## Current situation

A study conducted by The Public Opinion Research Center (CBOS)<sup>1</sup> shows that engineers and IT specialists are one of the most respected professions. Around 75% of respondents claim that they have respect for these jobs. Analysis of similar studies from previous years portrays that while engineering jobs were always highly respected, the respect for them slowly grows even more.

## Factors causing the growth

Every year there is a bigger demand for engineering jobs on the market. Technology is constantly evolving, and society needs more and more highly skilled specialists. Universities are constantly adding new majors that are even more specialized in the fields. All of that shows people that engineering jobs are becoming more and more required.

Moreover, engineering itself is a difficult discipline. The training that engineers must undergo is long and complex. You must be knowledgeable in a variety of fields, such as physics, advanced mathematics, chemistry, and computer science. Society knows that and sees that engineers are hard to be replaced.

## Future challenges

The technology development and automation process are not going to decline any time soon. That makes engineers more and more needed and respected.

However, engineering jobs are facing some challenges in these aspects as well. Still to this day technical jobs appear as more manly. Many women that studied engineering leave the field. If there will not be any changes done, the respect to engineers might decline over time.

Furthermore, the job automation process will affect a huge number of people. Those who will not be able to adapt might lose their respect for engineers.

## Recommendations

While the status of engineering jobs looks quite stable, I make the following recommendations to address future challenges:
1.	Universities and companies should attract more women to the field.
1.	People that work in the fields that will be affected by the job automation should get help in adapting to the new reality or in changing their career path.

## Conclusion

Engineering jobs are one of the most respected professions in Poland and their respect constantly grows. There are some challenges that need to be overcome, but I believe it will be done.

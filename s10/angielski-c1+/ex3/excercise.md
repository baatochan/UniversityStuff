Hello

In my introductory email to I wrote that a part of our course assessment will be a business report.

Because this semester there have been a few abrupt changes, I think it will best for us to start language training for the report now and write it later as soon as possible.

This is why, today we are doing some practice we need before writing the report and next week we will write it (of course there will be a time limit of about one week, so there will be enough time)

Today I would like to ask you to study some information which will be useful when writing a business report. Writing a formal business report is your assessment task and we were planning to do it together in class, however, the situation has changed and I thought that maybe it will be easier for you to study some materials on your own. Later, i.e. next week I will post the task I would like you to do as your assessment (I am not sure how long we will all  have to work from home  but maybe it will be better if you write the report at home and send it to me. This way when we return to the university, we will have time for speaking practice).

First some explanation about reports and how to write them:  
https://www.lexico.com/grammar/structuring-a-business-report (there is a sample report at the end)

For vocabulary useful in writing a report see:  
www.blairenglish.com/exercises/emails/exercises/vocabulary-writing-business-reports-english/vocabulary-writing-business-reports-english.html

And finally some information on how to write a report for the CAE exam.  
www.italobritannica.com/Writing%20reports%20for%20the%20CAE%20exam.pdf

I would like to look especially at the model answer and useful vocabulary.

Maybe it is also worth taking a look at some information on differences between formal and informal English, as these reports have to be written formally. Even if for some of you this information may seem obvious, I decided to recommend these links, just in case:

https://www.engvid.com/english-resource/formal-informal-english/  

This is your work for today. Next week I will send you your writing task.
I realize that it would be much easier if I could simply explain everything to you and we could first have some practice together. This is why when assessing your reports I will try to be friendly and understanding :)

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me :)

Hello

Generally our course is devoted the language used in the academic and business  environment.  
We are going to start with academic language to discuss our current situation when we are still students, and then we are going to pass on to the language we use at work.  
The first task I would like to ask you to do is reading the first 12 pages of a document titled C1plus Academic Profile. You can do the exercises (I will post the key next week so you can check if your answers are right), however, for me this file is also simply a good source of vocabulary.  
We are going to work like this: when I ask you to do some exercises, the key will be available the following week but a few times I will ask you write something and send it to me.

This week there is no need to send anything.  
If you have questions, feel free to contact me (email or Skype).  
This is our work for today. I will be in touch.

Have a nice weekend!

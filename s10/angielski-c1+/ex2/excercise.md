Hello

Today we will continue working on vocabulary used to describe our career and also academic experience.  
Now that we’ve practiced some vocabulary, I’ll ask you to put it to practice and make a short presentation of yourself which you often have to make at a job interview, it’s often called an elevator pitch (for a better definition see: https://www.thebalancecareers.com/elevator-speech-examples-and-writing-tips-2061976).  
First maybe you should study some materials and find more tips how to prepare such a presentation well, some very informally presented information is available at:  
https://theinterviewguys.com/write-elevator-pitch/  
you can also watch two videos on the same subject:

Now the task:
1.	Prepare and elevator pitch for yourself and send it to my e-mail address (about 150-180 words)
2.	Look Student’s academic profile again p. 16, there are some examples of job interview questions choose 2 and answer them in writing (about 50 words each question)

Please send editable file (word, PDF)  
Deadline Thursday, May 14.  
If you have questions, feel free to contact me :)

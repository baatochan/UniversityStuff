### Task 1 - Elevator pitch

My name is Bartosz. I am a Junior Software Engineer. I have been working for Nokia for over a year as part of a team that focuses on developing solutions for a new generation 5G Base Transceiver Station. I have recently graduated as Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and currently pursue my master's degree in the same field of studies. I have professional and academic background on working with C++, Python, Java and web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. I have had experience in software development as well as in software design. I also have experience in all phases of product development from planning and requirement gathering, to implementing and testing. In my spare time I'm active in the open-source community and my contributions can be found on my GitHub profile. I'm open for new job opportunities and would be thrilled to bring my development, analytical and teamwork skills to your company. Here's my resume. Let me know if you would be interested to meet with me for an official interview.

### Task 2 - Answers to interview questions
#### What do you consider to be your weaknesses?
I have couple of weaknesses - my biggest one, I would say, is inability to accurately estimate how long a task will take me to finish. I quite often underestimate the time needed for smaller tasks which results in not having enough time for bigger ones. Sometimes I miss deadlines. I'm trying to overcome this issue - I've already read a few books about time management and started to implement what I learned. That helped me to become more organized in general.

#### What type of work environment do you prefer?
I can adapt to a few different types of environment. I am flexible. In my last company, we had a strict environment and every project was carefully planned by software architects. However, my studies taught me to work with a lot of freedom and I performed well and had no issues. I'm not familiar with the corporate environment here, could you describe it to me?

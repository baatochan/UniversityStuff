Hello

Today I would like to ask you to read C1+ General Scenario 3.

Answer the following questions in writing:  
You can find them in the file. The answer for all three questions should not exceed 200 words.

A) Discuss these questions with a partner:
1. Which countries support the electric car market? How do they
support it?
2. Is Poland ready for electric cars?

Deadline: Tuesday, June 10.

This is our last task, next week we are finishing the course.

I am a little late with marking because I have received a lot of homework from my students, but I will try to finish marking by next Thursday and when I have marked your last task I will also send you your final assessment for the course.

Good luck!

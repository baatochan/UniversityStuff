### Task 1 - What are some popular electric car models?

The automotive market is transforming and fully electric cars are the future. Currently, most popular models on the market in Europe are Nissan Leaf, Tesla Model S, and Renault ZOE. Out of these three Model S is the one that is most known for the wider audience. It is a premium car that is known for its innovative autopilot system. On the other hand, Leaf is popular because it's for over 10 years on the market and even though it is a full-size car it is still a budget model. The third one motioned by me is a very small budget city car.

### Task 2 - Which countries support the electric car market? How do they support it?

There are few countries/regions in the world that has a significantly bigger market share of electric cars than others. These countries are Norway, Iceland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the USA (especially California). All of them tries to encourage people to switch to e-cars using similar methods:
* Electric cars are made to be cheaper than gas ones. This is done in different ways by making taxes and other fees smaller or non-existent for electric cars or by offering subsidies when purchasing an electric car.
* Electric cars are made to be more convenient to use. This is done by eg. letting electric car drivers use bus lanes, offering free parking in city centers, offering special parking spots only for green cars, or making some parts of a city electric-only (only green cars can enter such district).

### Task 3 - Is Poland ready for electric cars?

It depends on how you want to use a car. A lot of cities offer some benefits for electric car owners like mentioned by me special parking spots or permission to use bus lanes. The Polish government offers some subsidies when choosing an electric car as well. All of that makes an electric car a good choice as a city car. The main issue in Poland for owners of green cars, in my opinion, is the lack of public car chargers that could be used for longer trips. Right now the only convent way that is to charge your car is to do it in your home.
